# In with the new, out with the old
My website started as a very simple lander page. From there I progressed it to a fairly modern and semi-responsive website with various pages, blog posts, and project overviews. With that in place I started looking to the next iteration, which would come prior to my mass importation of content/projects/posts.

After much contemplation I knew that I wanted to improve three things in 'v2.0' of austinkettner.com. The first was the layout, mainly structurally (HTML/CSS), I wanted to implement a fully responsive layout instead of the faux responsive layout I had at the time. Secondly, I wanted to improve the layout of the site visually, particularly though I wanted to improve the display of the 'my work' section. Thirdly, I wanted to greatly simplify the CSS, which while not large or unwieldily, was something that could be improved.

# Along comes v2.0
I can thankfully report that I have accomplished all of my goals for the v2.0 implementation. Structurally this is built using Bootstrap 3 RC1, versus the previous usage of [Frameless Grid](http://framelessgrid.com/). I also took this time to redesign the site almost entirely. Vastly improving the layout of the 'blog' section, and combining the Home + Work pages into a single introductory experience showcasing my work. Finally, thanks to the framework provided by Bootstrap I was able to drastically reduce the amount of CSS needed (custom-wise, obviously Bootstrap 3 is a massive CSS asset on its own).

# Whats leftâ€¦
As I mentioned I still need to import all of the content (i.e. work examples, and 'about me' content), however, outside of that, there are just optimizations left for my v2.0 website. Come v3.0 though we will be looking at some fancy additions for sure.
