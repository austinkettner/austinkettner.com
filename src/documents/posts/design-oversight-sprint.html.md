There are various posts on the web centered around the fact that everything in todays world seems to be broken, in some manor or another. I find that one of the most frequent examples of this is when larger companies or projects have a website with noticeable visual imperfections.  

In my soon to be occasional 'design oversight' posts I will look at a specific example of this, describe the issue, and then outline the usually quick solution. I rather like the idea of documenting these 'errors' in a centralized location, and what better spot to do this than on my personal site.
