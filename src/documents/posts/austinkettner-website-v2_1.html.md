# v2.1 = Refinement
Back in August when I released my new website, it was rebuilt from the ground up. Focused on solving many issues I had with my original site. With v2.1 as with many *.X updates, the goal is solely on refinement.

Changes include...
* Shift from Bootstrap RC1 to Bootstrap 3.0 (along w/ fixes due to 3.0)
* Addition of new projects and a fixed display of on the home page.
* Slimmed down a few outside references.
* Slight style tweaks on the Post and Project pages.

Thats it! Pretty simple, as I mentioned previously my gameplan is for v3.0 of my website to really focus on fancifying things, so I am really excited to start work on that soon.
