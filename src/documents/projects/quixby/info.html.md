Quixby is a web app designed to simplify the process of selecting computer hardware components. Specifically, Quixby aggregates computer hardware inventory from various online computer parts retailers. Quixby provides users a next-generation interface that guides you through each computer part necessary for a full computer, however after each part you select, Quixby intelligently filters out incompatible parts in the following
categories you load.
