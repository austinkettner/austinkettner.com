The People Startup (TPS) is really best classified as a 'Social Experiment'. Originally conceived by a business partner and friend of mine, James Hilton (@cr0wmium). The premise being that everyone joins TPS as a user, creating a large acquirable user base for a large company. Then, we would sell the startup to the company, and whatever the the acquisition price is, 70% of that capital would go back to all the users who joined.
