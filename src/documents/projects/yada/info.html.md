Yada is the latest endeavor of mine, and it best described by the snipper on our site.

"Yada is safe. Yada is fun. Yada is free! Yada is an open place to share items for sale, borrow, swap, rent, or barter, completely for free; it really is the place to share almost anything in your life that you want to exchange for something else. We’ve built Yada to be the best place to exchange stuff because that is something we’ve wanted too.

Whether it is piano lessons, an old book, or a red dress that you want to enjoy for only an evening, Yada is the place to share things with anyone, or only the people you want to see it. The important part is that Yada is extremely simple to use, built entirely around your mobile device, and isn’t time consuming."

As sole designer and developer so far, Yada's design, animations and general flow are all driven around the philosophy of driving peace of mind. See the screens below for a better feel of what Yada is all about.
